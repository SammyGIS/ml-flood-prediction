
# Flood Modeling using Random Forest
This project is a machine learning model built using different APIs to source data. The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of flooding in a particular area based on certain topographial and environmental factors such as landuse, slope and elevation.

## Project Outlines

* An introduction to the project and question being answered (e.g.: what areas are susceptible to flooding)

* Details on the dataset on which the discovery is being performed (dependent variable) (e.g.: source, data, projection, format and what processing might have been done on it)

* Data preprocessing details on the independent variables that are included, including source and why it was selected)

* The task that has been selected and why, e.g: are you performing classification or regression

* The selection of the algorithm and why, e.g.: CART, random forest, etc.

* Running the algorithm and any hyper-parameterization

* Evaluation of the results â€“ include accuracy, ROC-AUC, and at least one other measure from the confusion matrix and explain what they     represent

* Finally, run the model on-some untrained data and present the results in a map
